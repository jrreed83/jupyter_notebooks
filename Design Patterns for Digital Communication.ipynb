One thing I want to try to avoid is being tied to a particular type of input.  I don't want to implement separate differential encoders when the bits are coming in one at a time and when they are given to me all at once.  I want to capture the *essence* of the algorithm in a flexible and reusable module.  And if I can do this using functional programming techniques, then that's just icing on the cake.  \n"

What does currying look like in Python? Let's look at a simple example before getting to the differential encoder.  Consider a simple `adder` function that takes two numbers and adds them together:"
